# MIAMI VICE 🌴🕶️

## What is this, the 80s? 📺✨
Yeah, you guessed it. *Miami Vice* : the show that's basically crime fighting meets pastel fashion disaster. 👮‍♂️💖  
It's like someone looked at the 80s and thought, "What if cops wore neon and listened to saxophones all day?" 🎷🌈

## Why watch this relic? 🤔💎
- Because apparently solving crimes with a mullet and a cigarette is peak detective work. 🚬💇‍♂️
- The soundtrack is 90% saxophone solos, 10% actual music. 🎵🎷
- Plot? Who needs plot when you have Don Johnson's eyebrow game? 🤨✨
- It's basically *CSI* but with more neon and fewer lab coats. 🔬➡️🌈

## Things you'll definitely notice: 👀📝
- Everyone smokes like it's their cardio. 🚬🏃‍♂️
- The suits are brighter than your future. 🌟👔
- Hair bigger than the crimes being committed. 💇‍♀️🔫
- Miami looks like a pastel fever dream. 🏖️🎨

## Best episodes to pretend you're cultured: 🎭📚

1. Brother's Keeper  
Pilot episode where Crockett and Tubbs prove crime doesn’t stand a chance—mostly because they keep stealing the spotlight (and maybe a few speedboats) 🚤😎.

2. Calderone's Return  
Two parts of ‘Who’s bad?’ — Spoiler: It’s still Calderone, and Crockett’s hair is just as perfect as ever 💇‍♂️🔥.

3. Out Where the Buses Don't Run  
Where the action’s so intense even the buses refuse to show up 🚌❌. Miami’s public transit: officially on vacation 🌴😅.

4. Golden Triangle  
Two parts of international intrigue, because one part wasn’t enough to confuse everyone 🌍🕵️‍♂️🤯.

5. Little Prince  
An episode so good, even the criminals pause to admire the sunset… before getting arrested 🌅🚓.

6. Definitely Miami  
When you’re not sure if it’s a crime show or a travel ad—spoiler: it’s definitely Miami 🌞🌴🕶️.

7. The Afternoon Plane  
The only time catching a plane feels more dangerous than catching a criminal… Miami traffic, am I right? ✈️🚗💥.

8. Payback  
Revenge is a dish best served cold—unless you’re Crockett, who prefers it with a side of sunglasses and cigars 😎🔥💼.
