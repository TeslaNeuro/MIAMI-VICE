## What is this, the 80s? 📺✨
Yeah, you guessed it. *Miami Vice* : the show that's basically crime fighting meets pastel fashion disaster. 👮‍♂️💖  
It's like someone looked at the 80s and thought, "What if cops wore neon and listened to saxophones all day?" 🎷🌈

## Why watch this relic? 🤔💎
- Because apparently solving crimes with a mullet and a cigarette is peak detective work. 🚬💇‍♂️
- The soundtrack is 90% saxophone solos, 10% actual music. 🎵🎷
- Plot? Who needs plot when you have Don Johnson's eyebrow game? 🤨✨
- It's basically *CSI* but with more neon and fewer lab coats. 🔬➡️🌈

## Things you'll definitely notice: 👀📝
- Everyone smokes like it's their cardio. 🚬🏃‍♂️
- The suits are brighter than your future. 🌟👔
- Hair bigger than the crimes being committed. 💇‍♀️🔫
- Miami looks like a pastel fever dream. 🏖️🎨
