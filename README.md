# MIAMI-VICE

## What is this, the 80s?

Yeah, you guessed it. *Miami Vice* — the show that’s basically crime fighting meets pastel fashion disaster.  
It’s like someone looked at the 80s and thought, “What if cops wore neon and listened to saxophones all day?”

## Why watch this relic?

- Because apparently solving crimes with a mullet and a cigarette is peak detective work.
- The soundtrack is 90% saxophone solos, 10% actual music.
- Plot? Who needs plot when you have Don Johnson’s eyebrow game?
- It’s basically *CSI* but with more neon and fewer lab coats.

## Things you’ll definitely notice:

- Everyone smokes like it’s their cardio.
- The suits are brighter than your future.
- Hair bigger than the crimes being committed.
- Miami looks like a pastel fever dream.

## Best episodes to pretend you’re cultured:

- Season 1, Episode 1: The grand intro to this pastel madness.
- Season 2, Episode 9: When things get dark... but not too dark. We’re still in the 80s.
- Season 4, Episode 12: Because Don Johnson’s smoldering stare cures all.

## How to enjoy this repo:

1. Laugh at the fact that this is actually a show.
2. Remember: pastel suits > bulletproof vests.

## Final thoughts:

If you want a show about serious crime and even more serious fashion mistakes, *Miami Vice* is your jam.  

Or just binge some cat videos — honestly, same level of sophistication.

*Pro tip:* If you catch yourself thinking “Why is this so cool?”, just blame the saxophone.
