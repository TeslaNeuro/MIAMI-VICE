# MIAMI-VICE 🌴🕶️

## What is this, the 80s? 📺✨
Yeah, you guessed it. *Miami Vice* — the show that's basically crime fighting meets pastel fashion disaster. 👮‍♂️💖  
It's like someone looked at the 80s and thought, "What if cops wore neon and listened to saxophones all day?" 🎷🌈

## Why watch this relic? 🤔💎
- Because apparently solving crimes with a mullet and a cigarette is peak detective work. 🚬💇‍♂️
- The soundtrack is 90% saxophone solos, 10% actual music. 🎵🎷
- Plot? Who needs plot when you have Don Johnson's eyebrow game? 🤨✨
- It's basically *CSI* but with more neon and fewer lab coats. 🔬➡️🌈

## Things you'll definitely notice: 👀📝
- Everyone smokes like it's their cardio. 🚬🏃‍♂️
- The suits are brighter than your future. 🌟👔
- Hair bigger than the crimes being committed. 💇‍♀️🔫
- Miami looks like a pastel fever dream. 🏖️🎨

## Best episodes to pretend you're cultured: 🎭📚
- Season 1, Episode 1: The grand intro to this pastel madness. 🎬🌈
- Season 2, Episode 9: When things get dark... but not too dark. We're still in the 80s. 🌙✨
- Season 4, Episode 12: Because Don Johnson's smoldering stare cures all. 😍🔥
